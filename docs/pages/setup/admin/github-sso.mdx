This guide explains how to set up GitHub Single Sign On (SSO) so you can
automatically map teams in your GitHub organization to users and roles in
Teleport.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub organization with at least one team.

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/5. Create a GitHub OAuth app

Create and register a GitHub OAuth App. When you do so, ensure that your OAuth
App's "Authentication callback URL" is the following:

```
https://PROXY_ADDRESS/v1/webapi/github/
```

`PROXY_ADDRESS` must be <ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>the public
address of the Teleport Proxy Service</ScopedBlock><ScopedBlock
scope="cloud">your Teleport Cloud tenant address</ScopedBlock>.

Instructions for creating a GitHub OAuth app are available here:

[Creating an OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)

## Step 2/5. Define the GitHub authentication connector

Define a GitHub authentication connector by creating a file called `github.yaml`. 

You can do it with the following command:

```code
$ tctl sso configure github --id <client-id> --secret <client-secret> -r octocats,admins,access | tee github.yaml
```

The resulting file should look like this:

```yaml
kind: github
version: v3
metadata:
  # Connector name that will be used with `tsh --auth=github login`
  name: github
spec:
  # Client ID of your GitHub OAuth App
  client_id: <client-id>
  # Client secret of your GitHub OAuth App
  client_secret: <client-secret>
  # Connector display name that will be shown on the Web UI login screen
  display: GitHub
  # Callback URL that will be called after successful authentication
  redirect_url: https://<proxy-address>/v1/webapi/github/callback
  # Mapping of org/team memberships onto allowed logins and roles
  teams_to_logins:
    - organization: octocats # GitHub organization name
      team: admins # GitHub team name within that organization
      # Maps octocats/admins to the "access" Teleport role
      logins:
        - access
```

The values of `client_id`, `client_secret` come from the GitHub OAuth App you created earlier. `redirect_url` is automatically configured by [`tctl sso configure github`](../reference/cli.mdx#tctl-sso-configure-github) based on the settings of Teleport cluster. 

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Teams to logins mapping"
>
  The flag `--teams-to-logins` (`-r` for short) can be repeated multiple times with each repetition creating additional mapping entry.
  
  If multiple roles are desired, they can be listed separated by commas: `-r org,team,role1,role2,role3,...`.
</Admonition>

Teleport will request only the `read:org` OAuth scope. Read more about OAuth scopes in [GitHub's documentation](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/).

## Step 3/5. Test the connector

To ensure the connector is working as intended: SSO flow is passing, roles are assigned as intended etc., you can now test it using [`tctl sso test`](../reference/cli.mdx#tctl-sso-test) command.

```code
$ tctl sso test github.yaml
# If browser window does not open automatically, open it by clicking on the link:
#  http://127.0.0.1:62482/e1fadd3f-dc6a-420b-9791-94fd29dfc2db
# Success! Logged in as: ExampleGithubUser
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Authentication details:
#    logins:
#    - access
#    roles:
#    - access
#    traits:
#      github_teams:
#      - admins
#      kubernetes_groups: null
#      kubernetes_users: null
#      logins:
#      - ExampleGithubUser
#    username: ExampleGithubUser
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [GitHub] Received claims:
# organization_to_teams:
#   octocats:
#   - admins
# teams:
# - admins
# username: ExampleGithubUser
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [GitHub] Connector team to logins mapping:
# - logins:
#   - access
#   organization: octocats
#   team: admins
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For more details repeat the command with --debug flag.
```

The test command can accept the auth connector from standard input. The pipeline may also utilise `tee` to save the connector to file:

```code
$ tctl sso configure github ... | tee github.yaml | tctl sso test
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  When going through the GitHub authentication flow for the first time,
  the application must be granted access to all organizations that are
  present in the "teams to logins" mapping, otherwise Teleport will not be
  able to determine team memberships for these organizations.
</Admonition>

## Step 4/5. Create the connector

Once you are satisfied with the connector, you can finally create it using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create github.yaml
# authentication connector "github" has been created
```

## Step 5/5. Configure authentication preference

Configure the Teleport Auth Service to enable the GitHub authentication
connector.

Create a file called `cap.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  type: github
  webauthn:
    rp_id: 'example.teleport.sh'
version: v2
```

For `rp_id`, use the public address of your <ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>Teleport Proxy Service</ScopedBlock><ScopedBlock scope="cloud">Teleport Cloud tenant</ScopedBlock>.

Create the resource:

```code
$ tctl create -f cap.yaml
# cluster auth preference has been updated
```

<Details scope={["enterprise", "oss"]} scopeOnly={true} opened title="Static configuration file">

You can also edit your Teleport configuration file to include the following:

```yaml
# Snippet from /etc/teleport.yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: github
```
</Details>

You can now log in with Teleport using GitHub SSO.


Run the following to log out of Teleport and log in again using GitHub SSO.

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
$ tsh logout
# Logged out all users from all proxies.
$ tsh login --proxy=tele.example.com
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
$ tsh logout
# Logged out all users from all proxies.
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh
```

</ScopedBlock>

When you sign in for the first time, you will see a prompt to authorize your
GitHub OAuth app:

After logging in successfully, you will see the following:
